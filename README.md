## Abstract

This paper introduces imagineRio Narratives, a map-based storytelling application created for those interested in the history of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Aimed for students and educators, our tool allows users to write their own stories using the geographic data available at the imagineRio platform. It also encourages visual storytelling through an intuitive user interface, removing the need for GIS expertise or any special training. In the _narrative_ layer, we discuss the idea behind the project, our previous experience with ESRI StoryMaps, and how the Covid-19 pandemic shaped our development process. In the _hermeneutics_ layer, we discuss the design choices shaping our editor, the technical choices shaping our data model, and how we collected feedback from users in Brazil and the US. We conclude by presenting our vision for imagineRio as an inclusive historical mapping platform that fosters open research and scholarship.
