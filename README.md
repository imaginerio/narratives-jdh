## Abstract

We introduce _imagineRio Narratives_, a map-based storytelling web application designed for people interested in the history of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Aimed at students and educators, our tool allows users to write their own narratives using the geographic data available at the _imagineRio_ historical mapping platform. It also encourages visual storytelling through an intuitive user interface, removing the need for GIS expertise or any special training. In this paper, the _narrative_ layer discusses the idea behind the project, our previous experience with ESRI StoryMaps, and how the Covid-19 pandemic impacted our development process. The _hermeneutics_ layer presents the technical choices shaping our design and data model, and how we collected feedback from users in Brazil. We conclude by presenting our vision for imagineRio as an inclusive platform that fosters open research and scholarship.
