# Rio Narratives: A Customized Map-based Storytelling Application for imagineRio

![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)

One of the goals for imagineRio, a digital web atlas that presents the history of Rio de Janeiro, was a platform for shared research and scholarship. While the Historical Geographic Information System (HGIS) that underlies imagineRio is filled with shared research and depends on collaboration, how to publish from imagineRio has always been more elusive. A new version of imagineRio opened up the possibility of developing a custom writing application designed with our users in mind. Such an application would allow users to create their own narratives using our HGIS. For creating such a map-based narrative application, we sought a simplified design that would allow our viewers to create narratives without needing to know GIS or the intricacies of the acquisition and use of spatial data. Our open-source, web-based application gives all users access to imagineRioâ€™s temporally accurate basemap, as well as to its curated primary sources--georeferenced historical maps and urban plans. This paper explores how we designed the application Rio Narratives / Narrativas do Rio and created a community of early users who shaped its final development. Undertaken during the covid-19 pandemic (severe in both the US and Brazil), this project marks a turning point in our our methodology, for we recognized the urgent need to engage meaningfully with those using imagineRio and to offer creative, but technically vigorous, ways for new users to engage with our digital atlas.
